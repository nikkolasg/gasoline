           <p class="font-weight-bold">TREAT THIS SIMULATION AS AN EXPERIMENT -
           It does not take all factors into account (notably the fee
           structures, the potentially higher total gas spent per block in the
           future etc. It considers the average stats from the last few blocks
           in the chain and the rest as all things equal. </p>
           <p> This simulation takes the current distribution of gas found in
           the recent epochs, and extrapolates it to determinate when the
           network will not be able to grow anymore.</p>
           <ul>
                <li>For each deadline, we put as many
                    window posts as required to prove all the sectors proven
                    from the beginning of the simulation that belong to the
                    current deadline. We divide evenly accross all epochs in the
                    deadline the number of window post to put on chain.</li>
                <li>We consider that one window post can
                prove 2349 sectors. In practice window post can prove more but
                it's average that most window post only includes one partition.</li>
                <li>Then we fill the block with as many prove
                    commits and pre commits as possible (keeping both equal),
                    until we reach the average total gas used.</li>
                <li>We stop the simulation when we reach
                    a certain percentage of the initial growth rate (1%
                    currently), and record the various informations.</li>
